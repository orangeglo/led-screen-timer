# LED Screen Timer
A Game Boy ROM for measuring screen latency.

When you trigger the screen change, the ROM will attempt to turn on an LED connected to the cart, as well as the IR LED on a GBC. You can film the screen and LED in slow motion together to roughly measure screen latency, and observe other aspects of the screen's performance.

## Cart Compatibility

The only off the shelf cart that is supported is the [insideGadgets 512KB cart with LED](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/product/gameboy-512kb-rom-only-with-white-led/). It may be desirable to modify the cart and move the LED to be more visible depending on your filming setup.

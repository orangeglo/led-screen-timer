# LED Screen Timer
A Game Boy ROM for measuring screen latency. Runs at 60 FPS. Triggering a screen change inverts the palette.

When you trigger the screen change, the ROM will attempt to turn on an attached LED. You can use the [insideGadgets LED card](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/product/gameboy-512kb-rom-only-with-white-led/), a [Power Antenna / Bug Sensor](https://wiki.telefang.net/Power_Antenna), or the GBC's built in infared LED. You can film the screen and LED in slow motion together to roughly measure screen latency, and observe other aspects of the screen's performance.

## Power Antenna / Bug Sensor

If you have the "Power Antenna" or "Bug Sensor" LED link port accessory, this rom will light it up on the screen transition.

## Cart Compatibility

The only off the shelf cart that is supported is the [insideGadgets 512KB cart with LED](https://shop.insidegadgets.com/product/gameboy-512kb-rom-only-with-white-led/). It may be desirable to modify the cart and move the LED to be more visible depending on your filming setup.
